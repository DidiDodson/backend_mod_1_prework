## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
--> This article resonated with me a lot. I love learning, and I have applied many of the strategies in this article to my previous studies. I already know that one thing I struggle with is resting enough. I get really motivated to work or learn, and I just go and go. It's especially bad in my current (soon to be previous) type of work where I am under really strict, high-stress deadlines with big money on the line. While working on this prework, I've been setting alarms to tell me when to take breaks; otherwise, I won't stop for 3-4 hours. That's been a good step forward.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

puts "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

the octothorpe (#)

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer is a whole number. A float has a decimal in it.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

p "#{animal}"

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation allows you to stick data in the middle of a string.

animal = "zebra"
  p "One really majestic animal with stripes is the #{animal}."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

You can use gets.chomp to elicit an answer to a question on the same line.
ex:

p "what is your favorite color?"
  gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

a) length: you can use variable.length to show how many characters are in a strings

b) .sub and .gsub: used to replace parts of a string. Similar to using "find and replace" in MS Office programs.

.sub replaces a single occurance, whereas .gsub replaces all
