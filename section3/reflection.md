## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

a) I really liked the S.M.A.R.T. goal setting idea. I don't consider myself a goal-oriented person, and I often struggle to set goals for myself or have a long-term vision in mind. I also tend to live in the moment and am pretty whimsical, so getting a little extra structure for developing a path to a goal is helpful.

b) One thing I like about coding is how it seems to be a career/pursuit built for life-long learners, people who are motivated to take on challenges and discover new things. Having a Growth Mindset allows us to be open to facing new challenges, accepting constructive feedback, improving and innovating over time, and overall being more confident in what we do. That just resonates with me in general.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

As stated above, I'm not great at setting goals. Once I set my mind to something, I pursue it to completion, but getting to the point of determining what that something is takes me a long time. THe article states that developing one skill can help us develop another; this makes sense to me in terms of improving goal setting skills.

I value a lot of the main points in this article, and are already engaged with many of them. The process of reflecting (self-awareness), seeing mistakes a key component to learning and growth, being willing to seek help when needed are all things I already do. I think I can work towards taking on more challenges (I'm surprisingly risk averse).

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {cats: 3, dogs: 6, fish: 200, birds: 12}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts states.values[1]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
puts states.keys
puts states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
shopping_list = {
  "vegetables" => "kale",
  "fruit" => "strawberries",
  "meat" => "salmon",
  "carbs" => "French bread"
}

In arrays, order matters, so you would use hashes for a list in which order doesn't matter. If I were to put my shopping list in an array, it would imply that the order of the items meant something. Whereas, if I put my shopping list in a hash, I could call each individual item as needed in any order that makes sense or creates value (as I walk around King Soopers).

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
As always, I feel I need more practice!! No questions so far.
